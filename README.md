# Zoomer

A VSCode extension which allows for finely tuned zoom levels.

## Motivation

I built this since I was frustrated with not being able to get the perfect text size; too big, too small, ugh. So I built this.

## Demo

## Usage

### Keybindings

Zoom In:

- Mac `Command` + `=`
- Windows `Control` + `=`
- Linux `Control` + `=`

Zoom Out:

- Mac `Command` + `-`
- Windows `Control` + `-`
- Linux `Control` + `-`

### Settings

Head to Zoomer settings in Code and set your custom zoom factor!
